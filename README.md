### Picturematic

Anyone is aware of trivial slideshow changing slides one by one with opacity fading. Such slideshows take the state of a picture with full opacity every step. It's not convinient when a video based on permanent change of slides is going to be created. Multiple slides with permanently changing alpha value of several layers keep an observer in illusion of watching a slow motion movie.
